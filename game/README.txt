INSTALLATION
=======

Installation Instructions:
Instructions are very simple!
These instructions assume you have a fresh install of DDLC.

1) Back up your DDLC files to a safe location.
2) Select ALL files in this folder.
3) Copy ALL files into the fresh installation of DDLC's game folder. If you have any conflicts with the files you are moving into the game folder, overwrite them.
4) Run DDLC.exe

That should get the mod to run, easy as that!

Tabuukilla's Notes:
DDLC was a mistake.
But the Purist Mod was premeditated.

...I wonder if you can use the Konami code in this mod...
