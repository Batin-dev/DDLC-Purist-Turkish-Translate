    "Learning all this is so surreal. It's like when you know something's wrong, but only later realize the extent of how awful it is."
    "I think it's funny how this turned out. Not that kind of funny, but I'm talking more about how I came to find out about this."
    "Natsuki seemed bent on not letting me find out about this situation. She didn't always do a great job, but she continued to try hiding it."
    "But then there's tonight. Because my bed is up against the wall, you can only fall off of it if you lay down on the left side."
    "I was the first one to get into bed that night, and I laid down on the right side."
    "So, the only option was for Natsuki to lay down on the left side."
    "If that didn't happen, she wouldn't have fallen off the bed, I wouldn't have seen her bruise, and I never would've learned the truth behind all this."
    "I know I was trying to give Natsuki time to think, but a thought crossed my mind."

    n 12bc "Huh?"

    mc "He lost his wife, his financial situation was rough, and so on."
    n "I think so."
    mc "Would he have tried to take his life?"
    mc "I'm sorry if that sounds random, but it's something I was thinking about."
    mc "He had to have some reason to live, wouldn't he?"
    n "Or you're looking too deep into it."
    mc "No, I think I'm onto something."
    mc "Otherwise it leaves only two possibilities: there was another reason he distanced himself from everyone, or he had no reason to live."
    mc "There's nothing pointing to the first possibility and I don't think it'd make sense if there was, either. As for the second possibility, he hadn't even attempted suicide, right?"
    n 12bg "Again, you're looking way too deep into it."
    n "You can't tell how someone is feeling when you don't know them well enough."
    n "It's just not possible."
    mc "I also remember you suggesting that it was possible the reason your dad was so obsessed with you being successful was because he didn't want to see you end up like himself."
    mc "What if he kept living for you?"
    mc "If it were true then it would be a twisted, sick way to convey love when you look at how he treated you."
    mc "But even with how angry I am at him, I can't totally ignore that maybe that was the situation."
    "I'm even more conflicted now. There is absolutely no justifying his actions, and violence is never the answer, but maybe I really am looking at this from the wrong perspective."
    "Perhaps there is no {i}right{/i} perspective to this, either."
    "Again, what he did was despicable, but I do wonder..."
