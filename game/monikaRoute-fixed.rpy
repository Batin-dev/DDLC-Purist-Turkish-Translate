    "Not a beautiful smile, some dramatic kiss, a heartfelt confession, or even to have her problems solved."

    "The only reason she rejected it before was that she believed it was not 'real', and so it would evaporate like the morning dew."
    "I guess I was a bit off the mark, then."
    "It wasn't so much the mere fact the happiness was found 'in a dream', but rather the fact it would disappear."
    "She desired a connection that would persist beyond the 'end of the game', no, perhaps even something that might echo beyond what she called a 'modification' and would affect even the original."
    "In short, something so impossible it might be called lunacy. She had already accepted the fact that anything done 'here' would not affect the 'original'."
    "She used that fact as a shield, not only towards my constant attempts to reach out to her, but also to her own doubts about finding happiness here."
    "If she could convince herself everything here was comparable to a dream, then she only had to wait until she 'woke up'."
    "Maybe she was also afraid of the pain, too, of losing whatever happiness she found here."
    "She always kept saying 'go pursue another girl'. It would hurt, if she found happiness here but then couldn't take it with her, wouldn't it?"
    "She didn't want that pain either."
    "So, she took the path of avoidance. Avoiding a situation where she'd be able to feel that kind of pain of having something you held dear ripped from you."
    "But I didn't let her take it."
    "Now the only path left is to take a leap of faith, since I've eroded her will to simply run away, I think."
    "There's no evidence that says something done here can be taken back with her. But that doesn't mean she can't move ahead with the belief that it can be done."
    "That is to say, 'Even if it means nothing, I will move ahead as if it does mean something'."
    "There is nothing stopping Monika from pursuing her own happiness, facts be damned, other than her own mind."
    "Pursuing a dream that so blatantly goes against seemingly objective facts of the world is awfully self-indulgent, egotistic, and is practically arrogance."
    "It could even been seen as despicable. Yet, someone has to believe in things that aren't."
    "How else can they otherwise {i}become{/i}?"
    "Monika told me time and time again that nothing I could do would matter."
    "If nothing I do matters, then the only things that matter are what I do, because that's all that there will be. Maybe I can't change the big picture, maybe nothing I do will affect the original..."

    "She went back to being cautious."
